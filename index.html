                        <h2>Missouri River Eagle</h2>
                        <p>The Missouri River Eagle passenger train, run by the
                            Missouri Pacific Railroad, still existed by the
                            summer of 1967.  It ran between the St. Louis, MO
                            Union Station and the Kansas City Union Station.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1967, this train had only a couple of cars and
                            offered no amenities such as food or drink service.
                            It was typically powered by one of GM's E series
                            passenger engines.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Union Pacific Portland Rose</h2>
                        <p>Union Pacific's Portland Rose passenger survived for
                            almost forty years, originally running from Chicago
                            to Portland, OR.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1954, the name was assigned to a new origin,
                             Kansas City, MO, but still terminated in Portland.
                             It survived until Amtrak took over in 1971.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1967, in contrast to the Missouri River Eagle,
                            this train retained many of the amenities typical
                            of American passenger trains in their glory days:
                            attractive equipment (cars) painted in Union Pacific
                            armour yellow, dining cars with appetizing menus and
                            comfortable, reclining seats (coach!) with more
                            than twice the legroom of today's domestic, first-
                            class airline seating.
                        </p>
                        <p>Like the Missouri Pacific Eagle, the Portland Rose
                            in 1967 utilized GM's E series passenger engines.

                        <h2>California Zephyr</h2>
                        <p>The California Zephyr retained its identity, route
                            and appearance essentially unchanged since its
                            inception in 1949 until its takeover by Amtrak in
                            1971. It ran from Chicago to Oakland, California,
                            across the bay from San Francisco.
                        </p>
                        <p>It differed from the Missouri River Eagle and the
                            Portland Rose in that it was jointly sponsored by
                            three different railroads: the Chicago, Burlington
                            and Quincy; the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
                            the Western Pacific.  Advertised as "the most
                            talked about train in the country", it ran along
                            what is arguably the most scenic route in the U.S.,
                            passing over historic old railroad bridges spanning
                            the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and through the
                            heart of both the Rocky Mountains and the
                            Sierra Nevadas.</p>
                        <p>The California Zephyr utilized what most people
                            remember as the most prestigious passenger equipment
                             ever to run during passenger train travel's heyday
                             in the 1940's and 1950's.  The cars, manufactured
                             by both the Budd and Pullman Companies, were of
                             fluted stainless steel and carried the California
                             Zephyr train name on their display boards, with the
                             railroad owner's name stenciled in black on the
                             upper side corner of the car.  The most
                             dramatic cars were the "bubble", or dome, cars,
                             which allowed a 360 degree view from comfortable
                             seats on the upper level over the roof.  These cars
                              variably served as coaches, sleepers (bedroom
                              cars) and diners.</p>
                          <p>The only comparable
                             train in prestige might be considered New York
                             Central's 20th Centry Limited running between
                             Chicago and New York.</p>
